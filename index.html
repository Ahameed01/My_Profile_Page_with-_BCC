				<h4 id="about">PROFILE SUMMARY</h4>
				<p>I am a staunch believer in the power of learning and teaching as well. I strongly emphasize the need for proper communication and this is because it is the strongest tool in any activity. I speak and write English language (British) fluently and I am learning a few others.
				In my spare times, I practice coding in Java, and Python. I believe that one's strength lies in his hobbies which led me to taking creative writing as a profession. I am a public speaker. I have had audiences from different levels and age brackets. I speak on various topics - religion, academic, entrepreneurship, leadership, politics among others.
				I play word games, scrabble and puzzle mostly and I read a wide range of writings (works of literature, articles, blogs). I rarely follow the news because I believe its not so interesting.<br>I am presently on a Web Development learning process with <strong>Basic Coding Challenge</strong> which has been fun so far & I hope to get the best out of the programme. We have wonderful mentors, always willing to help...
